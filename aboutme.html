        <h2>Biography <br><br></h2>
          <h5>I offer intimately unique experiences through simple, yet compelling designs<br><br><br></h5>
            <article class="itme">
              Design by and by has been an elusive term for me. <br><br> Everything we see in the world in the world today, either natural or otherwise, has been designed to some degree. Not to get neither philosophical nor theological, what I mean to say is that this: Design is something that is everywhere around me; however, this was not something that I had fully realized until rather recently.<br><br> Being an aspiring musician on the side (I wrote, arranged, produced, and self-released my first EP on all streaming platforms July of 2017), I find good design one of the most optimal things to someoneâ€™s experience with anything. <br><br> Without a good roadmap, without good planning, people will often not only misunderstand, but also all together miss the entire point of what you are trying to convey. Of course, sometimes, disarray may be the entire point of what you are trying to convey, but even disarray in and of itself, has to have a pointed structure in order to convey it. <br> I want to be able to create products that will improve quality of life for my users. Although my passion for design is geared towards music, that does not mean it has to be limited to such things only. However, I would like to say, that I want to be able to use my designs to help people experience music in a better way, and to feel less stressed out about how, for instance, a person interacts with their music streaming platforms, and feel more in control.
